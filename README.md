# Subarray
Given an array arr[] containing only non-negative integers, our task is to find a continuous subarray (a contiguous sequence of elements) whose sum equals a specified value target. You need to return the 1-based indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements of this subarray. We need to find the first subarray whose sum is equal to the target.
